# Rust Data Structures and Algorithms

This Rust project aims to implement various data structures and algorithms to help me understand and practice fundamental concepts in computer science. Currently, the implemented data structures include:

1. Stack:
   - Parentheses Checker: Checks whether a given string of parentheses is balanced.
   - Number Converter: Converts numbers between different numeral systems (e.g., binary, decimal, hexadecimal).
   - Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation: Converts infix expressions to postfix notation & Evaluates postfix expressions.
   - Infix to Prefix Conversion & Evaluation: Converts infix expressions to prefix notation & Evaluates prefix expressions.
   
2. Queue:
   - Hot Potato Game: Simulates the "Hot Potato" game where players pass a potato around in a circle.
